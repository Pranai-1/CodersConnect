No need to pass session as a prop in session provider
we cannot have getServerSideProps function in app directory

server components which doesn't have "use client" can access session using getServerSession(options) directly,no need to create 
a function named getServerAuthSession(ctx) in authoptions

client components can use useSession() hook 

middleware file should be at the same level of app directory


//without a defined matcher this one line applies next-auth to entire project
// export {default} from "next-auth/middleware"

//To apply for matcher files

// export const config={matcher:[]}
